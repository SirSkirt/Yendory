# Engine status

Phase 1 (one shared Rust Engine with compatibility tests) is under way. This page says what
has been checked, how, and what has not.

## Verified (by `cargo test --release` and `reference/selftest.py`)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| numpy reference self-test: finite-difference gradients on every parameter, causality, ablations, round trip, focus masks | all pass |
| Golden vectors (3 small configs: full, `no_efferent`, `loops=1`): loss, 12 logits, 62 gradients each | pass; worst gradient error ≤ 1e-6 of the largest gradient |
| **Real checkpoint, step 15,000**: last-position logits for 9 prompts × 4 ablation modes, uncached and KV-cached | worst relative error 3e-5 (tolerance 1e-4) |
| Same: greedy generations (up to 24 tokens), uncached and KV-cached | token-identical to the reference |
| Same: prompts longer than the 256-token window (247 and 291 tokens) | identical, cached and uncached |
| Same: loss and 131 gradients (sampled + the 32 largest) on a training sequence | gradient error ≤ 4e-7 of the gradient norm |
| Same: one AdamW step from the stored optimizer state, focus Joint and Right | parameter deltas within 1.1e-4 of the learning rate; with Right focus, the count of untouched parameters matches the reference mask (845,824) up to float32 rounding |
| `.nnova2` load → save | byte-identical to the original file |
| Malformed checkpoints (truncated, trailing bytes, bad config, absurd sizes) | return errors, no panic |
| Step 19,000 (owner's lessons) — same checks | pass **locally only** (not published; see tests/compat/README.md) |

## Not verified

- Nothing here has run on Android or in a Windows app. CI builds and tests the library on
  Ubuntu and Windows only.
- Training dynamics over many steps (a long Rust run vs a long reference run). One gradient and
  one optimizer step on real weights are checked.
- Lesson pipeline, Foundation V2, rehearsal, measurements — not ported yet (Phase 2).

## Findings while porting

1. **KV cache past 256 tokens (fixed).** The Neural Nova cache kept appending with growing
   RoPE positions after the window was full, while the reference re-reads the last 256 tokens
   with positions starting from 0 (the only positions the model was trained on). Measured logit
   drift was up to 1.1. The Engine now re-windows exactly like the reference.
   *Cost:* once a conversation passes 256 tokens, each new token re-reads the whole window
   (~360 ms per token in the development container used for this work, vs ~1.5 ms inside the
   window; a phone will be slower).
   See decision D10.
2. **Header bytes differ between implementations (fixed).** Python and serde format the config
   JSON differently, so files were interchangeable but not byte-identical. See docs/FORMAT.md.
3. **`no_right` and `no_afferent` are the same ablation for outputs.** Silencing the right
   hemisphere zeroes everything it injects into the left, which is exactly what cutting the
   afferent path does. They always produce identical logits; diagnostics should not present
   them as two independent measurements.
4. **Lesson parser not carried over yet.** Neural Nova's `unified.rs` depends on the old v1
   `trainer.rs` / `dialogue.rs`. Rather than carry v1 code, Phase 2 ports the lesson pipeline
   with `lessons.py` / `train_lessons.py` (step-19,000 package) as the reference behaviour.

## Decisions still open

| # | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | License | owner will decide later |
| D2 | Parameter cap (`MAX_PARAMETERS = 1,200,144`, currently not enforced anywhere) as a configurable safety limit | open |
| D3 | Package extension/container wrapping `.nnova2` | open |
| D4 | Runtime exports may drop optimizer state | open |
| D5 | One repository | **decided: monorepo** |
| D6 | Nova consumes the Engine via git tag | open (recommended) |
| D7 | Old v1 brain / `.nhyb` | **decided: dropped** |
| D8 | Studio design language (mockups first) | open |
| D9 | Who reviews Engine changes from the Nova side | open |
| D10 | Context policy past 256 tokens: exact re-window (current, matches reference) vs. a faster chunked re-window (re-read once every ~64–128 tokens; outputs differ from the reference past 256 tokens) vs. the app trimming history itself | open |
